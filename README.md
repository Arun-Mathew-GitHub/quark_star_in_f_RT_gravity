# quark_star_in_f_RT_gravity

Source code for Quark star in f(R) = R + alpha R^2 + omega RT gravity. 						 
														
The main purpose of the code is to identify the central value of Ricci scalar R_c correspoding to a given central density. The equation of state of the matter is given by the bag model, with pressure expressed as p = k(epsilon - 4B), where B representing the bag.								 
 														 	
Initially the code solves the starobinsky gravity to identify the correct central value of Ricci scalar. Then using this value the main will calulate correct value of R_c for R + alpha R^2 + omega RT gravity.
